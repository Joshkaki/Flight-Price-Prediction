# Flight-Price-Prediction
In the Dataset we have Flight Travel Price listing for various locations in India. The time period of the data is from March 1st 2019 to June 9th 2019. Based on the given data, created a Machine Learning model to predict the Flight price for future dates based on the given factors. Using this model the user can check the predicted flight price of different services without actually going into their website. 


Steps Followed:

1. Importing Data from the Data source.
2. Performed Data cleaning for the values that are not of any use for the analysis of the dataset.
3. Performed Data Analysis and Data Visualization for getting better understanding of the data and getting the trends and insights of the data.
4. Performed Feature Engineering techniques to find out the best features that contribute in making the prediction model
5. Built a Gradient Boosting Model which gave the best prediction score for the dataset.
